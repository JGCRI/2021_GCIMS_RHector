# 2021 GCIMS RHector Tutorial

Materials for the R Hector tutorial for the 2021 Annual GCIMS Meeting. While having experience with R is helpful it is not essential. The objective of the tutorial is to provide some hands-on experience with Hector and may cover some basic R & R studio concepts. To learn more about R programming we direct attendees to checkout the [NSF's Resources for Learning R](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/resources-learn-r).



## Preparing for the tutorial 

 Before beginning, tutorial attendees should ensure that both R and Rstudio are installed on their machines.
 
 * Follow R installation instructions for your platform [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
 * Install Rstudio, the IDE we will use with R from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 

**Window Users Only** 
If you are working on a Windows machine you will complete an additional step and install RTools, see [here](https://datag.org/resources/documents/spring-2018/37-de-barros-installing-r-on-windows/file) for details.
